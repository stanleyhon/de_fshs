Version 0 Revision 18 - Claire Bennet's

- Fixed you crappy revision counting, if you want extention maths, please learn to count first.
- Added rooms
- Fixed the doorway problem (OMG, Theres so many of them!)
- Edited Entry gates
- Added Chimnies
- Heightened the roof thingies

Notes:

- At the front of school there is a locic_relay, it isn't connected, but i'm not sure if i should delete or not, decide for yourself.
- You've gotta fix the texturing on the new rooms. I can't texture.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0 Revision 15 - Micah Edited

- Deleted your secret ladder to the roof
- Added not-secret ladder to roof
- Removed some other secrets. Fair gameplay is better gameplay.
- Made WORKING lift.
- Added custom textures.
- Added roof geometry.
- Doorway problem: In the doorways with the func_rotating doors there is a gap between the corridor brush floor and the classroom brush door, this is the doorway, when i checked other rooms, they all had this gap 
in between it.

Notes:
- I got a bit distracted this week, sorry I couldn't do more.
- The files are now starting to need compression. Map is now over 6mb. Custom textures don't help.
- I know the textures are crap. Incase you missed Claire's post, we desperately need a texturer.
- @claire: The BSP file in the zip includes the textures. If you release, release this file, not one you compiled yourself. Because of the custom textures, I have included a folder called de_fshs in the zip. Place this in your counter-strike materials folder. (mine's at "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\dougallj\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials\"). They will not be automatically included in the files, but should make everything look good on your computer.
- There is a small bug near the windows in W1. Also in the room next to the computer room.
- The custom brick texture is present around the edges of windows. It should probably be swapped for the concrete one.
- we should add the rooms to the right wing.
- Once we have those rooms, we should work on creating exteriors for release 1 (outside of the hall, outside of cohen) so that it starts to look good. I might thing about adding a skybox for kilgour.

Version 0 Revision 15 - Micah Edited

- General geometric fixes and changes
- General proportion fixes and changes
- General texturing fixes and changes
- General additions of rooms, windows and doors.
- Increased number of spawns, 23 per team (46 players max.)
- Spawn points now have visgroups ("T Spawns" and "CT Spawns").
- Fixed a func_detail displacement which was causing a compile error.
- Straightened main stairs on the left and right
- Moved right stairs further back as part of proportion fixing.
- Added stairs on the back left.
- Made left and right veranda lengths more accurate.
- Extended terain at left
- Added elevator shaft
- Added place-holder for cottage.
- Added store rooms on right.
- Began Cohen roof
- Added windows to principal's stairwell (no stained glass texture, used normal window texture)
- Added fountain-quad side windows to front rooms on right side.
- Made front wider.
- Added doors to rooms adjacent to principal's stairwell. 
- Extended quadrangle and added small part of hall.
- Began over-pass
- Added supporting pillars on left and right.
- Added more shrubs (fountain quad)
- Moved fountain quad sculpture across to make room for another bench.
- Changed trees a bit. More realistic placement, no going through walls, but some touching walls.

Notes:
- "because when 3D camera viewing, tree model dissappears because of viewing range"
	So increase the viewing range:
	Tools -> Options -> 3D Views -> Model Render Distance (drag to 10000 while editting big models)
- We've almost finnished the Wilkins building... When we do, I think we should polish it up and release version 1, which would be our first stable release.

Version 0 Revision 14 - Porsche Cayenne Driving Claire Bennet

- Fixed tree penetration of concrete... on one side
- Changed the tree's models
- Added more trees
- Added computers and some chairs and some computer cases to the video editing suite plus some tables
- Added a toilet room in the Lower wilkins art room
- Fixed wierd 3D skybox thing
- Added other side of school,
- made a TEMPORARY (NOTE: TEMPORARY) ramp that in real life does not exsist, to connect the left side of the school to the fountain quad, 
this greatly increases activity and fun for the time being, until the actual stairs have been made that will serve as a walking space

Notes:
- Need to fix positioning of the lower wilkins art room
- Penetration of the walls in fountain quad is hard to fix because when 3D camera viewing, tree model dissappears because of viewing range
- Desk in computer editing suite is brushes therefor are yukkie
- Desk models in-game are too small for our map scale
- Computers seem to fly too far when its naded... no weight...
- Need to fix placement of trees (IMPORTANT: the current placement is very bad, its very hard to do)

Version 0 Revision 13 - Micah Edited

- Fixed your textures
- Fixed your bushes
- Improved your stairs
- Added fountain quad ground texture
- General expansions... New rooms and new windows.
- Changed windows in the video editing room, they're the same as everything else.
- Removed the evil shrubs
- Added shrubs on the other side of the quad.
- Added stairs near old principals office. They're useless because the exits on each level don't exist.
- General fixes and geometry changes
- Changed many unseen faces to no-draws
- Started on small art-room area at bottom of wilkins right-wing stair-case

Notes:
- Trees look autumny... Should they?
- There should be many more smaller trees
- Can you fix the bits where the trees stick through walls?
- I think the stairs on the right wind are too far to the right... If you get what I mean.
- I think I've narrowed the proportion problem down. The wilkins front veranda is too small. It should be wider and longer, which will give us room to put in the things we need.
- The entire left wing is complete, with the exceptions of windows on the front and the stair-case at the back.

- No-draws are temporary
- No-draws ontop of the scrubs at fountain quad are now fully covering scrubs
- Tried to make you know that bit of bark at the front of the school on the ground floor bit of bark? Extremely hard
because floor is not flat, need solution
- IMPORTANT: Why is the game rendering some scrubs not in the flowerbed, but they don't appear in hammer?
check entity: func_illusionary, might have messed something up
- My texturing is very bad, apply the correct ones thanks

----

Version 0 Revision 10 - Claire is Hot Edited

- Made some new rooms,
- Attempted to expand right side of wilkins (you need to actually do it)
- Fixed some texture thingies
- Made a tank, give me some cover when you shoot me from the top
- Made a combine tank to the top, see if it falls off

Notes:
- You need to expand the right side
- On top floor the floor is uneven with bits that go down especially near the classrooms, try and fix that with
proportion in mind
- See if you can get that texture to work, if it does, i'll make a texture with credits on it overlapping a default texture 
Therefor we have CREDITS TEXTURE! YAY!

----

Version 0 Revision 9 - Micah Edited

- Altered door behaviour. Doors now only open when use is pressed, can be closed by pressing use and stay open for 30 seconds before closing themself.
- Numerous fixes and changes to geometry and proportion.
- Added some windows and doors.
- Added CT spawns (wilkins, second story, front), as these will be version specific, they are only for testing purposes.
- New skybox, much more Australian weather. (I hate Australian weather)

Notes:
- All walls need to be changed to width 16.
- We should start expanding about now, just add lots of rooms and stuff...
- Don't bother adding windows if width is not 16, fix the width first, or leave that to me.
- You left an apostrophe out of "Claire Bennets Hot Little Hands".
- I changed log formatting a little, only tiny content changes. Turn "Word Wrap" on in Notepad when viewing (Format > Word Wrap).
- I forgot to mention that the new arches can be hidden with a vis-group (since rev 7).

- Re-did the scale. Much more realistic.
- Added ground infront of wilkins.
- Added bush... It sucks.
- Added rails to stairs.
- Extended front stairs.
- Re-did the arches... Not sure if they're better, but they fit.
- Added floor for front of top story.
- Fixed W3 door and window positions.
- Many small changes, mostly related to size.

Notes:
- Whole wilkins front should be abit wider.
- Need to start making the rooms.
- The window has about 12 panes, not 4 (but I don't know why we'd bother making all 12, maybe make 4 panes look like 12 by adding more easil breakable seperators)
- Need to figure out how to import textures... And how to make models.

----

Version 0 Revision 6 - Claire Bennet Edited

- Shortened Extention of stairs to no protrusion by stairs steepened and classrooms extended (Tested, walkable)
- Extended Temporary Skybox
- Made a test window on ground floor W5 and 1st floor same spot, crossbars on window are breakable and break like wood at 80 damage, glass breaks like glass
- Fixed problem, where 1st floor stairs main platform/1st floor (actual floor) was higher than the ground floor ceiling, fixed it by lowering main platform/1st floor until it was low enough to be the ceiling for the ground floor
- Created Careers Room Floor + Shared Wall
- Created History Store Room Floor + Shared Wall
- Made Ground Floor Cilinder things for the wall (Teh Pr0n3ss)

Notes:
- You need to texture the stairs back wall
- You need to texture the 1st floor (not ground) W13,W14 floors
- You need to texture (if you want to keep it) the window on the left (looking straight on) on room W5

----

Version 0 Revision 5 - Micah Edited

-Extended 2nd level of wilkins. Textured stairs to standard concrete.
-Added Stairwell wall for guidance for stair adjustments.
-Added the other layer of the stairwell.
-Adjusted proportions.
-Temporary skybox added.
-Added some rooms.

Notes:
-Stairs are good, but extend too far back. They need to (somehow) fit within the building.
-Need textures

----

Version 0 Revision 4 - Claire Bennet Edited

Everytime i edit the map i'll try to make a list of some stuff i did, and some stuff i need to fix, i suggest you do the same?

-Made stairs, damn they were hard getting it perfectly 1/2 leveled
-Made small stairs down from ground floor wilkins into courtyard
-Made small stairs down from ground floor wilkins directly infront of center of school


Notes:
-Please texture them, couldn't be bothered to find yours... most of them are grouped for your convenience anyway
-Can't seem to group the arches? grouping worked, adding it to a custom VisGroup didn't... 1/2 of it adds rest doesen't tho high-
lighted
-Leave the other stairs to me, or if you want to do it... copy and paste my other one for uniformity
-do the top level, i dunno how to hell ima do the little jail bar things :P
